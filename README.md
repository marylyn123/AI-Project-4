TASK 2 SUMMARY
Using AI-enhanced test automation tools significantly improves test coverage and maintenance. 
In this task, I automated login functionality using Testim.io testing both valid and invalid credential scenarios. 
The AI feature automatically detected UI element changes—like a renamed button ID—and updated the script without manual intervention. 
This reduced test flakiness and the need to frequently revise selectors. 
The tool also suggested edge cases, such as empty field submissions, which I hadn’t initially considered. 
After executing the test, I received a visual report with pass/fail results, time logs, and screenshots.
Compared to traditional manual testing, this approach increased accuracy, minimized human error, and accelerated execution time. 
Overall, AI testing tools help teams scale QA efforts while maintaining reliability across changing user interfaces.
