# Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key

def manual_sort_dicts_by_key(dicts, key):
    for i in range(len(dicts)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(dicts)):
            if dicts[i][key] > dicts[j][key]:
                dicts[i], dicts[j] = dicts[j], dicts[i]
    return dicts


# AI-Suggested Code:
def sort_dicts_by_key(dicts, key):
    return sorted(dicts, key=lambda x: x[key])


### Analysis

# The AI-suggested version uses Python’s built-in `sorted()` function with a lambda for the key, which is highly efficient, concise, and leverages Python’s standard library. It is also more readable and less error-prone. The AI version is slightly more efficient because direct key access (x[key]) is faster than dict.get(key). However, the difference is negligible for small lists. If the key might be missing, the manual version is safer but marginally slower due to the method call overhead.

# The manual implementation uses a nested loop (selection sort), which is complex and less efficient for large lists. It is also more verbose and harder to maintain.

# **Conclusion:**  
# The AI-suggested code is more efficient and preferable for real-world use due to its speed, clarity, and reliability. Manual sorting is only educational and not recommended for production code. For most practical purposes, the AI version is preferable unless missing keys are a concern.
